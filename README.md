*Data provided by Booz Allen Hamilton*

We used the data provided by Booz Allen Hamilton to construct an interactive map. This map displays the data and analysis onto an interactive map highlighting trash cleanup zones. It showcases the success of ocean cleanup efforts and allows users to select zones and view a data analysis of that specific zone. The analysis includes the types of trash picked up, the amount of trash that was collected, the density of trash in a certain area, and the efficiency of people in collecting trash. The analysis also compares how cleanup efforts in one zone compare to others and allows users to pinpoint underperforming cleanup efforts.
